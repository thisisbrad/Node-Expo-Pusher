# Node-Expo-Pusher

This is a bootstrap server for React Native Push Notifications. The goal is to provide a server developers can fork and deploy on Heroku for React Native Push Notifications.

Directions:

- git clone git@github.com:thisisbrad/Node-Expo-Pusher.git
- npm install

Grab token from Expo and try in in the form. If the token works go on to deploying to Heroku.
